# MBACourseDesign
This project is to help my research professor to present class network for her MBA class.

Shiny_survey_working file uses Shiny to generate a prefilled survey for students to indicate their classroom connections.

Then Network_Plot file uses Shiny generates an interactive report for every student in the class. 

All data used for display are fake.
